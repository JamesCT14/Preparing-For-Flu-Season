# Overview:

This GitHub README outlines a project aimed at analyzing states at risk of high mortality rates during the flu season in the US. The primary objective was to determine the optimal deployment of medical agency staff to specific states and timeframes. The project employed a variety of tools and techniques, including Excel and Tableau, to address business requirements, conduct data analysis, and make informed recommendations.

# Project Scope:

+ Data Collection and Cleaning: The project commenced by gathering historical mortality rate data from CDC sources, spanning the past 10 years. Rigorous data cleaning procedures were applied to ensure data accuracy.

+ Integration and Transformation: Census data was integrated with mortality rates to identify states with higher proportions of at-risk populations. This enriched analysis provided a holistic view of the states' vulnerabilities.

+ Hypothesis Testing: To understand the variables affecting mortality rates, statistical hypothesis testing was executed. This step unearthed critical factors influencing death rates during the flu season.

+ Visual Analysis and Forecasting: Utilizing Tableau, the data was transformed into visual representations, enabling the identification of patterns and trends. Additionally, forecasting techniques were employed to predict future mortality rates.

+ Storytelling and Presentation: The findings were presented using storytelling techniques within the Tableau platform. This ensured clear communication of insights to stakeholders.

# Recommendations:

+ The recommendations derived from the analysis are flexible and interactive, tailored to stakeholders' needs:

+ Targeted Resource Allocation: Tailor medical agency staff deployment based on the identified states at risk. Allocate resources proportionally to states with higher mortality risk during the upcoming flu season.

+ Adaptive Strategies: Develop adaptable strategies that can be modified based on changing data and conditions. Regularly reassess states' vulnerabilities to ensure timely adjustments.

+ Data-Driven Decision-Making: Encourage stakeholders to base decisions on data insights rather than assumptions. This will enhance the effectiveness of resource allocation and mitigate risks.

+ Percentage Distribution of Staff: The ultimate recommendation involves distributing medical agency staff to desired states based on the risk levels determined by time series forecasting of next season's death rates. The percentage distribution ensures a responsive approach to the dynamic nature of mortality trends.

In conclusion, through the utilization of Excel, Tableau, and a comprehensive set of analytical techniques, this project empowers stakeholders with informed insights for effective medical agency staff deployment. The recommendations are adaptable and dynamic, aligning with the evolving needs and preferences of stakeholders, ultimately enhancing preparedness and response during the flu season.
